# Et Timores Cordis (Heart Rate) Game Project

## Summary
The nature of what makes a horror game create fear on whomever is playing is to be studied and explored by first reviewing several methods and effects that different environments can have on a subject with a Light and Sound driven scenarios, which includes real life subject testing.

In this project, with the help of a Heart Rate Monitor, the user plays a character in a crumbling space station that has had an unkown emergency and must explore it. ALL the assets, textures and some sounds, and most of the code, was made by me from scrtach.
