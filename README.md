# Et Timores Cordis (Heart Rate) Horror Game Project with Photorealistic 8k Textures

## Summary
The nature of what makes a horror game create fear on whomever is playing is to be studied and explored by first reviewing several methods and effects that different environments can have on a subject with a Light and Sound driven scenarios, which includes real life subject testing.

In this project, with the help of a Heart Rate Monitor, the user plays a character in a crumbling space station that has had an unkown emergency and must explore it. ALL the assets, textures, some sounds, and most of the code, was made by me from scratch.
